Disclaimer: this program is unlikely to be easy to get working for someone
unfamiliar, because of mild dependency hell.

This project uses makeshift to build.  If the makeshift directory is empty then
you probably need to run

$ git submodule update --init

Next you will need some dependencies:

- gcc (this code uses relatively new C++11 features so a recent compiler is
  required.  clang might work)
- boost
- Various libraries of mine, which can be found at http://github.com/jbytheway
  - optimal, my options parsing library
  - relasio, a Boostified readline wrapper library
  - settingstree, which provides a convenient data structure for managing game
    settings
  - messaging, a network protocol helper library

You may need to add some things to user.mk, e.g. to get the right g++ version
or allow it to find the others of my libraries if you didn't install them
(which you shouldn't need to).  Here for example is my user.mk:

  BUILD_CPPFLAGS += \
          -I$(top_srcdir)../messaging/include \
          -I$(top_srcdir)../settingstree \
          -I$(top_srcdir)../relasio \
          -I$(top_srcdir)../optimal

  BUILD_LDFLAGS += \
          -L$(top_srcdir)../settingstree/settingstree \
          -L$(top_srcdir)../relasio/relasio \
          -L$(top_srcdir)../optimal/optimal

See makeshift/INSTALL for details of what goes in user.mk.

Then to get a debug version it should be simply

$ make

You can run tests with

$ make test

though this will run quite a lot of trial games, which might take a while
(parallel make should be safe and is advisable where multiple cores are
available).
